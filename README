is a special file for the current user.

The configuration file contains commented fields itself (you can view
it for more information).

The configuration file in the user's home directory overrides fields
from the configuration file from the system directory.

4.1.1 Set fields and values

How to set fields in the configuration file you can know from comments
in the file.

Every field has form:

   `field_name=field_value'

There are available fields:

topic_proxy

   Values are on or off
   By default it is off.

topic_proxy_host
   Set the proxy host for the topic page downloading.
   Value is a domain name or an ip-address.
   By default it is empty.

topic_proxy_port

   Value is a decimal number.
   By default it is empty.

topic_proxy_type
   Set the proxy type for the topic page downloading.
   Values are socks4 or socks5
   By default it is empty.

topic_proxy_user

   The type of proxy should be socks5.
   Value is a string.
   By default it is empty.

topic_proxy_password

EXAMPLE

In this example we set configuration as different proxies for the
topic page and for the each image file.

    topic_proxy=on
    topic_proxy_host=somehost
    topic_proxy_port=1080
    topic_proxy_type=socks4
    topic_proxy_user=
    topic_proxy_password=

    image_proxy=on
    image_proxy_host=123.456.789.001
    image_proxy_port=8080
    image_proxy_type=socks5
    image_proxy_user=john
    image_proxy_password=smith

After that the program will download topic pages through a sock4 proxy.
And each file will be downloaded through a socks5 proxy with a user and
a password.

You can set off any proxy or both of them.

4.2 Run program

   `plnshots topic_url [ output_directory ]'

For example:

You run

   `plnshots https://pornolab.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12345 dir12345'

Then in directory dir12345 you will see downloaded screenshots.

If you don't set the output directory, then the screenshots will be
downloaded to the current directory.

   `/usr/local/bin/plnshots'

given topic on site https://pornolab.net and save the screenshots to the
